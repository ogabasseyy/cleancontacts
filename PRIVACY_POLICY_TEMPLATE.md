## 1. Data Processing
**We prioritize your privacy. All contact processing happens locally on your device.**

- **Modifications**: Any changes (merges, deletions, updates) are performed only when you explicitly confirm an action.

## 2. Third-Party Services
We use the following third-party services to improve the app experience:

- **RevenueCat**: Used to manage in-app purchases and subscriptions. We share anonymous purchase tokens to validate your premium status. We do not share your contact list with RevenueCat.
- **Google Play Services**: Used for distributing the app and managing standard operating system interactions.

## 3. Permissions
The App requires the following permissions to function:
- **Read/Write Contacts**: To analyze and clean up your address book.
- **Internet**: To validate subscriptions and download configuration updates (e.g., localized pricing).
