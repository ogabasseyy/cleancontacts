# 🚀 App Store Release Checklist (CleanContacts AI)

This document outlines the final steps required before pushing your app to the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.

## 1. Google Play Console Setup (Android)
- [x] **Privacy Policy**: Google requires a public URL for your privacy policy. 
  - *URL*: `https://cleancontacts-ai-privacy-793339695925.us-west1.run.app`
- [ ] **Data Safety Section**:
  - Disclose that you access **Contacts** (Personal Information).
  - State that data is used for **App Functionality** and is **Not Shared** with third parties (since we process locally).
- [ ] **OAuth Consent Screen**: Since you use the Google People API, you may need to submit your branding for verification if you exceed certain user limits.

## 2. RevenueCat (In-App Purchases)
- [ ] **Switch to Production API Key**:
  - Go to `app/build.gradle.kts`.
  - Replace the `REVENUECAT_API_KEY` (currently a `test_` key) with your **Public SDK Key** from the RevenueCat dashboard.
- [ ] **Verify Entitlements**:
  - Ensure the entitlement name in RevenueCat matches `"premium"` (used in `RevenueCatBillingRepository.kt`).
- [ ] **Configure Products**:
  - Ensure you have created products in Google Play Console (Subscriptions/One-time purchases) and linked them in RevenueCat.

## 3. Technical Final Checks
- [ ] **App Icon**: Replace the default Android icon in `app/src/main/res/mipmap-*`.
- [ ] **Signing**:
  - Create a **Upload Key** (JKS file).
  - Configure the signing profile in Google Play Console (Play App Signing is recommended).
  - **Important**: Your package name is now `com.ogabassey.contactscleaner`. Ensure you use this ID when creating the app in Google Play Console.
- [ ] **Minification**: R8 is now enabled in `build.gradle.kts`. Perform a final test of a `release` build to ensure no features are broken by obfuscation.
  - Run: `./gradlew assembleRelease`

## 4. Marketing & Stores
- [ ] **Screenshots**: Generate 5-8 high-quality screenshots showing the Dashboard, Scan Process, and Results screen.
- [ ] **Description**: Use a clear, benefit-driven description (e.g., "Clean thousands of duplicate contacts in seconds with AI-powered detection").
