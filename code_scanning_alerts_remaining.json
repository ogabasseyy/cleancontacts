It makes the program more difficult to understand and maintain, and can waste a programmer's time.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nThis rule applies to variables that are never used as well as variables that are only written to but never read. In both cases, ensure that no operations are missing that would use the local variable. If appropriate, simply remove the declaration. However, if the variable is written to, ensure that any side-effects in the assignments are retained.
